# LabVIEW-Tracking-Distance
Color-Based Object Tracking and Distance Measurement in LabVIEW

This program was developed to calculate the **distance between two objects** in each frame of a video. To achieve this, you must first provide **sample images** for object recognition using the **Vision Assistant**:  


## **Configuration Steps**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up ROI (Region of Interest)

- If necessary, adjust the **ROI** in the **Vision Assistant**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Save Sample Images
- Ensure the samples are saved in some folder as shown:

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Program  
- The program will prompt you to **open a video** in **AVI format** or another **compatible format**.  
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The video **must have no sound**, as audio is not supported.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Program Output  
- If the program runs correctly, you will see:  
  - üìä **A graph** displaying the distance measurement over time.

  - üé• **A filtered video** with multiple layers.  
    - You should see **only the color of the markers**.  
    - The **two tracked points** will be connected by a **line**.

## **üõ† Troubleshooting**
If the markers are not correctly detected, reconfigure the **Vision Assistant** and adjust the following parameters:  

- **üîπ Max of Matches**  
  - Set this value to **0** to ensure the program **tracks a point or marker**.  

- **üîπ Minimum Score**  
  - If set **too low**, the program may detect **too many false positives**, leading to incorrect tracking.  
  - If set **too high**, the program might **not recognize any markers**, resulting in **no measurements**.
